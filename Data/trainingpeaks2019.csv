,Bike,"Let's work on pushing our top end power. We are going to focus on Microbursts. Short and Long: 30/30s prep you for a sufferfest above threshold. You'll start with a 5 minute block of 30 seconds as hard as you can go followed by 30 seconds of rest. Rest is anything from easy pedaling (the first time you do these workouts you'll want to just spin easy) to tempo pace (as you get more comfortable with the intervals and want to tax your body a little more.) Following the last 30 second rest, launch directly into a 5 minute VO2 interval with an intensity around 110% of your FTP and hold it the best you can. Take 7-10 minutes rest then repeat it again. Worst 5 minutes known to mankind (and pyramid variation): Be prepared for varying lengths of intervals today (which is a great way to build race pace fitness.) Start with 10 seconds all out with 50 seconds of recovery. Next move to 20 seconds all out with 40 seconds recovery. Then 30 on/30 off. Then 40 on/20 off. Finally, 50 seconds all out with 10 seconds of recovery. Do 2 sets with 3 minutes of rest between them. If you're feeling up to a huge challenge, you can do the “pyramid” by completing the 5 minutes then immediately reversing the order and going back down. So 10/50, 20/40, 30/30, 40/20, 50/10, 50/10, 40/20, 30/30, 20/40, 10/50. Beware: that pyramid is REALLY HARD! 30/30s For The Win: It's all about short duration power today. Start with a block of 5 minutes of 30 seconds all out/30 seconds rest. Take 2 minutes rest then launch into a race winner. What's a “race winner”? It simulates attacking a field and breaking away. Start off by sprinting all out for 10 seconds, then ride 20 seconds at 150% FTP, followed by 3 minutes at 115% FTP. Sprint as hard as you still can for the last 10 seconds of the interval. You're looking at 3:30 of pure VO2 max beatdown. Rest for 5-7 minutes and then do it all over again.",,,2019-02-14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lap Swimming,Swim,"This pace changer swim workout blends steady, technique-focused swimming with shorter, sharper intervals that are designed to get you working harder while concentrating on one or two aspects of your stroke mechanics. Use the first 500 as a gentle warm-up swim, where you gradually build effort from low to moderate (no more than 5-6/10 RPE, rate of perceived exertion). The 4 x 125 should see an increase in effort (7/10 RPE) while also focusing on one part of your stroke you know needs special attention.
