"2700yds: 3x200 Pull/Paddles + 5x100 Big Toes Kissing","Swim","Strength swimming workout. Little bit of fun mixed in too! If you don't have swim paddles, just use a buoy. If you do have paddles, don't use a buoy and only use paddles for the pull section. For the ""toes kissing"", your goal is to try not to kick and keep the big toes gentle together. Almost kissing...get it!?!? It's hard...it simulates wearing a swim band around your feet but not quite as difficult. You will need to balance yourself in the water using your core to raise those hips! Good luck. .
